## What we’re about

At Brisbane Social Chess Inc, we're all about having a relaxed time pushing pawns and making memories. This isn't your serious, score-keeping chess club - we're a bunch of fun-loving folks who just want to shake the dust off our chess skills and enjoy good company. Our motto? Fun, friendly and free. Whether you're a chess newbie or a seasoned grandmaster, you're welcome in our club. We know that chess has a way of bringing together curious and creative souls from all walks of life. And when you put those eclectic personalities around a chess board, the good times will roll themselves.

So leave your ego at the door and come ready to laugh, learn, and make friends. Be a good sport when you lose - trust us, we've all been there. Lend a hand if someone needs a coaching or just some encouragement. And if you've got suggestions on new places for us to meet up and play, we're all ears!

The bottom line is, if you know the basics, you've got all the skills you need. Now's the time to get behind Brisbane's free social chess movement!

Our website is now established https://www.brisbanesocialchess.org.au/

We are going to be improving this as often as possible. Do you have web skills? Help us make it look cool!
